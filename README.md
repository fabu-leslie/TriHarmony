## TriHarmony: A Comprehensive Behavioral Data Collection Tool for Therapists and Parents

### Project Overview

TriHarmony is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify the process of collecting and sharing behavioral data between therapists, parents, and young children. The app is divided into three sections - specialist, parent, and child. Each section is designed to cater to the specific needs of the user.

Parents can use the app to provide data about their child's behavior, and to contact their therapist directly. Children can use the app to log their feelings and emotions, journal, and participate in entertaining activities. They can also earn stars that will allow them to redeem rewards, making the app more engaging for them. Specialists can view the data for each child and use it to develop an informed treatment plan.

### Key Features

-   Three distinct sections for specialists, parents, and children, each with unique features and functionalities.
    
-   A comprehensive data collection system that allows parents to log their child's behavior and children to log their emotions and activities.
    
-   A dashboard for the specialist, allowing them to view and compare child and parent data
    

### Problems Addressed

TriHarmony is designed to address the following issues:

-   Poor communication between parents, children, and therapists, leading to a lack of reliable and comprehensive behavioral data.
    
-   Difficulty in collecting data regularly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of the process.
    
-   The need to give children a voice and a safe space to express their feelings and emotions.
    

### Development Plans

TriHarmony will be continually developed to include the following features:

-   Integration with a family at-home rewards system to track the child's progress and incentivize their engagement.
    
-   Data will be rendered in charts and graphs
    
-   A journaling feature that enables children to express their feelings and emotions in a safe and private environment.
    
-   An activity section containing video links to fun and engaging activities that teach children about emotions and feelings.
